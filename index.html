            <p>1848: Birth of Mary Slessor.</p>

            <p>Mary Slessor , a Scottish Missionary in Nigeria was born in Aberdeen,Scotland.Her Mother was a deeply
                religious woman in the Presbyterian church.The family moved to Dundee in 1858 where Slessor began working
                in the linen mills at the age of eleven.She joined the local Christian youth club and 
                became convinced of a call to be a missionary
            </p>

            <p>In 1876,the United Presbyterian Church agreed to send her to Calabar as a mission teacher.
                She worked first in the missions in Old Town and Creek Town but in 1888 went alone to 
                work among the Okoyong.For the rest of her life,Slessor lived a simple life in a traditional
                house with Africans,concentrating on pioneering.Her insistence on lone stations often led her
                into conflict with the authorities but she was heralded in Britain as the 'white queen of 
                Okoyong'.She also concentrated on settling disputes,encouraging trade,establishing social changes
                and introducing Western education.
            </p>

            <p>Slessor frequently campaigned against injustices against women,took in outcasts and adopted
                unwanted children.In 1892 she was made vice-consul in Okoyong,presiding over the native court
                and in 1905 was named vice-president of Ikot Obong native court.In 1913 she was awarded the Order
                of St John of Jerusalem.Slessor suffered failing health in her later years but remained in Africa
                doing her missionary duties with diligence.
            </p>

            <p>Mary Slessor lived for a long time among the Efik people in Calabar in present day Nigeria.There She
                successfully fought against the killing of twins at infancy.Wichcraft and superstition were prevalent
                in Nigeria when she arrived there because traditional society had been torn apart by the slave trade.
                Human sacrifice routinely followed the death of a village dignitary and the ritual murder of twins was 
                viewed by the  new missionary with particular abhorrence.Her dedicated efforts to forestall this irrational
                superstitionwhere to prove a resounding success,as photographs of Mary with
                her beloved children testify.
            </p>

            <p>1915: Dies at the age of 66 in Calabar and was given a state funeral and buried in Duke Town,Nigeria.More than
                100 years since her death,Mary's legacy lives on both in Africa and closer to home.Indeed Africa lost a gem of 
            rare lustre. </p>
